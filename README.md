# linefollower
Code for a line following robot that I designed in order to teach a group of 5th and 6th graders about electronics.
The the robot uses a combination of LED's and photo-resistors for navigation.  An AVR Attiny44a micro-controller continually reads and compares the values of the two photoresistors.
