In my case I used UART 1200 baud rate. It may be increased or decreased depending on distance and environment. For longer distances lower baud rates works better as there is bigger probability for transmission errors. Maximum bit rate of transmitter is 8kbits/s what is about 2400 baud. But what works in theory usually do not work in practice. So 1200 baud is maximum what I could get working correctly.

Transmitter sends two commands (LEDON and LEDOFF) to receiver with 100ms gaps. Receiver recognizes these commands and switches LED on or off depending on received command. This way I can monitor if data transfer works correctly. If LED blink is periodical â€“ then transmission goes without errors. If there is an error in received data then LED gives shorter blink.
